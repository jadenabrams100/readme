# Introduction
Hello!  
This is the guide to the code and projects I have done as an NC State Student! To prevent unauthorized reuse of my code and other's code, the repositories of my work are private. I have listed my repositories, the classes they pertain to, and their descriptions below. If you would like to see any repositories, please email me at jadenabrams100@gmail.com and I'll share it with you!

# Available repositories

## School Projects

### Howler (CSC 326: Web Development)
This is a social media application I wrote to learn about mobile-first web design and user authentication. Users are able to "howl" with their friends and see what their friends have howled. The frontend is written in JavaScript with Bootstrap for styling, connecting to the backend using a REST API. The backend is written in NodeJS, with backend routing done using ExpressJS. A custom JSON Web Token is used to authenticate users and keep track of their requests.

### Coffeemaker II (CSC 326: Software Engineering)
This is a continuation on work from Coffeemaker in collaboration with Maciej Pruchnik (mpruchn@ncsu.edu), Shiva Ganapathy (sganapa3@ncsu.edu), Sammy Shea (sgshea@ncsu.edu), and Yunhao Si (ysi3@ncsu.edu). With the team, we implemented new roles for staff and customers, added order tracking, added access controls and authentication, and developed a new UI. I worked on the database elements of the additions, creating the model for how these users would be stored and the how the orders would go through the system.

### Binary Pwnage (CSC 405: Computer Security)
This is a series of writeups I did for different binary exploitation in CSC 405. In them, I describe how I exploited different programs to gain access to a shell with the program's privileges. The repository also contains the different codes I wrote to exploit the programs. my exploits were written with x86-64 assembly, C, Python, and Perl, with code compiled for Linux with GCC. The reverse engineerings were done with Ghidra.

### Web Security (CSC 405: Computer Security)
A series of writeups I did for exploiting security flaws in websites to capture flags from them. The exploits involving coding were written in PHP, and I used Burp Suite for monitoring and intercepting web traffic.

### Coffeemaker (CSC 326: Software Engineering)
Project I made in collaboration with Maciej Pruchnik (mpruchn@ncsu.edu) and Jonathan Kolesar (jkolesa@ncsu.edu) where we developed a "coffee maker" that interacted with a MySQL database from a web portal. Webpages were written in AngularJS with the backend written in Java. The frontend connects to the backend through a REST API, and the backend communicates with the database using Hibernate.

### Network Security Tools (CSC 474: Network Security)
Python tools I made for my Network Security class. These tools are 2 different types of port scanners and a program for cracking a custom hash algorithm.

### Assembly Projects (CSC 236: Computer Organization and Assembly)
A collection of assembly projects dealing with getting used to the language, file I/O, floating point operations, linking with C programs, string operations, and bitwise operations.

### Text To Music Converter(MUS 306: Musical Composition with Computers)
A program used to convert text files into music using SCAMP.

### Operating Systems Projects (CSC 246: Operating Systems)
A collection of C and Java projects dealing with low level operating system capabilities. These projects deal with system calls, process creation and management, thread synchronization, inter-process communication, resource allocation and deadlock, GPU processing, networking,k and encryption.

### Data Structures Design Project (CSC 316: Data Structures and Algorithms)
Project I made for my Data Structures Class where we had to design a system for a vacuum that tracked the rooms being cleaned. We had to design custom algorithms, determine the best data structures for them, and test our system with large data sets. Project was completed with the help of Tom Nixon (jtnixon2@ncsu.edu). 

### Data Structures Suite (CSC 316: Data Structures and Algorithms)
A collection of different Java data structures and algorithms from class workshops. Included are different types of graphs, lists, maps, queues, sets, stacks, trees, and sorting, graph traversal, minimum spanning tree, and shortest path algorithms.

### C Projects (CSC 230: C and Software Tools)
Projects I made while learning how to use C. Projects dealt with building C programs, strings, structs, memory management, bitwise operations, and pointers.

### System Test Plan Manager (CSC 216: Software Development Fundamentals)
Developed an application that manages system test plans for a program. Developed functionality for adding, modifying, and removing test cases with custom data structures. Project was completed with the help of Henry Kon (hakon@ncsu.edu).

### Project Backlog Manager (CSC 216: Software Development Fundamentals)
Created a Java program that tracks the product development using the Scrum workflow. Inside, a finite state machine models Scrum and controls task states.

## Personal Projects
This is where I place my personal projects! 
### Sitcom Doorbell
A Work In Progress device that mounts to a door and plays a random sitcom bumper music clip when the door is opened. It is a work in progress, with the code written in Python for a Raspberry Pi. A future iteration is in development, using an ESP32 running Arduino code to speed up booting and reduce power needs.

## In the works:
In the works I have my Senior Design project, my Cybersecurity Capstone project, and the Sitcom Doorbell whenever I get a chance.
