# Introduction:
Hello!  
This is the guide to the code and projects I have done as an NC State Student! To prevent unauthorized reuse of my code and other's code, the repositories of my work are private. I have listed my repositories, the classes they pertain to, and general descriptions at the bottom of this README. If you would like to see the code, please send me an email at jlabrams@ncsu.edu.

## Available repositories
* Data Structures Design Project (CSC 316: Data Structures and Algorithms): Project I made for my Data Structures Class where we had to design a system for a vacuum that tracked the rooms being cleaned. We had to design custom algorithms, determine the best data structures for them, and test our system with large data sets. Project was completed with the help of Tom Nixon (jtnixon2@ncsu.edu)  
* Network Security Tools (CSC 747): Python tools I made for my Network Security class. These tools are 2 different types of port scanners and a program for cracking a custom hash algorithm.
* Data Structures: A collection of different Java data structures and algorithms from class workshops. Included are different types of graphs, lists, maps, queues, sets, stacks, trees, and sorting, graph traversal, minimum spanning tree, and shortest path algorithms.
* Assembly Projects: A collection of assembly projects dealing with getting used to the language, file I/O, floating point operations, linking with C programs, string operations, and bitwise operations.
* Operating Systems Projects: A collection of C and Java projects dealing with low level operating system capabilities. These projects deal with system calls, process creation and management, thread synchronization, inter-process communication, resource allocation and deadlock, GPU processing, networking,k and encryption.
