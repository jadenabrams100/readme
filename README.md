# Introduction:
Hello!  
This is the guide to the code and projects I have done as an NC State Student! To prevent unauthorized reuse of my code and other's code, the repositories of my work are private. I have listed my repositories, the classes they pertain to, and their descriptions below. If you would like to see any repositories, please email me at jlabrams@ncsu.edu and I'll share it with you!

## Available repositories
#### Data Structures Design Project (CSC 316: Data Structures and Algorithms)
Project I made for my Data Structures Class where we had to design a system for a vacuum that tracked the rooms being cleaned. We had to design custom algorithms, determine the best data structures for them, and test our system with large data sets. Project was completed with the help of Tom Nixon (jtnixon2@ncsu.edu). 
#### Network Security Tools (CSC 747: Network Security)
Python tools I made for my Network Security class. These tools are 2 different types of port scanners and a program for cracking a custom hash algorithm.
#### Data Structures Suite (CSC 316: Data Structures and Algorithms)
A collection of different Java data structures and algorithms from class workshops. Included are different types of graphs, lists, maps, queues, sets, stacks, trees, and sorting, graph traversal, minimum spanning tree, and shortest path algorithms.
#### Assembly Projects (CSC 236: Computer Organization and Assembly)
A collection of assembly projects dealing with getting used to the language, file I/O, floating point operations, linking with C programs, string operations, and bitwise operations.
#### Operating Systems Projects (CSC 246: Operating Systems)
A collection of C and Java projects dealing with low level operating system capabilities. These projects deal with system calls, process creation and management, thread synchronization, inter-process communication, resource allocation and deadlock, GPU processing, networking,k and encryption.
#### C Projects (CSC 230: C and Software Tools)
Projects I made while learning how to use C. Projects dealt with building C programs, strings, structs, memory management, bitwise operations, and pointers.
#### System Test Plan Manager (CSC 216: Software Development Fundamentals)
Developed an application that manages system test plans for a program. Developed functionality for adding, modifying, and removing test cases with custom data structures. Project was completed with the help of Henry Kon (hakon@ncsu.edu).
#### Project Backlog Manager (CSC 216: Software Development Fundamentals)
Created a Java program that tracks the product development using the Scrum workflow. Inside, a finite state machine models Scrum and controls task states. 

### In the works:
In the works I have projects from my Software Engineering class (CSC 326) and my Computer Security class (CSC 405).
