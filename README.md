# Introduction:
Hello!  
This is the guide to the code and projects I have done as an NC State Student! To prevent unauthorized reuse of my code and other's code, the repositories of my work are private. I have listed my repositories, the classes they pertain to, and general descriptions at the bottom of this README. If you would like to see the code, please send me an email at jlabrams@ncsu.edu.
